abstract="Methods of statistical geometry are introduced which allow one to estimate, on the basis of computable criteria, the conditions under which maximally informative data may be collected. We note the important role of constraints which introduce curvature into parameter space and discuss the appropriate mathematical tools for treating curvature effects. Channel capacity, a term from communication theory, is suggested as a useful figure of merit for estimating the information content of spectra in the presence of noise. The tools introduced here are applied to the case of a model nitroxide system as a concrete example, but we stress that the methods described here are of general utility.",

abstract="Worldwide, 30{\%} -- 40{\%} of women and 13{\%} of men suffer from osteoporotic fractures of the bone, particularly the older people. Doctors in the hospitals need to manually inspect a large number of x-ray images to identify the fracture cases. Automated detection of fractures in x-ray images can help to lower the workload of doctors by screening out the easy cases, leaving a small number of difficult cases and the second confirmation to the doctors to examine more closely. To our best knowledge, such a system does not exist as yet. This paper describes a method of measuring the neck-shaft angle of the femur, which is one of the main diagnostic rules that doctors use to determine whether a fracture is present at the femur. Experimental tests performed on test images confirm that the method is accurate in measuring neck-shaft angle and detecting certain types of femur fractures.",

abstract="Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",
